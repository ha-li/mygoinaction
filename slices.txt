a slice:
-is a reference type that implements a dynamic array

-the syntax of a slice declaration is
 var v []T

   - the key word var declares a variable
   - v is the name of the variable
   - [] indicates a slice (a dynamic array)
   - T indicates the type the slice will holds

-the syntax of declaring and creating a slice is
 var v []T = { T {...}, T{...} }

 // a shorten syntax to make it more readable
 // will declare and initialize the variable
 v := []T

 // this creates a slice of T types with size of n
 // and sets the values to the nil equivalent for T
 v := make ([]T, n)

- the rule of thumb when doing initialization is
  1. for zero value, use the var form
  2. for extra initialization or method calls, use the := form
