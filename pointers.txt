-think of a pointer as an address

   feed *Feed

  so instead of thinking of feed as a pointer to Feed,
  think of it as the address of Feed

- in Go everything is passed by value, in the case of
  a pointer, since it is an address, the value of the
  address is copied into the function, and since
  it is an address, it effectively allows the function
  to access that memory space, effectively allowing
  the function to alter that address space, which is
  why pass by address/reference functions can change
  the value
