the init function is a special function that
will get called during the execution of a program
if that package is imported

   func init () {}


-no parameters can be passed in
-no return values

sometimes if you want to do call an init
block on a certain class without using that
class, you can use a blank import
which will discard the need to acutally
use the import, and just call the init
