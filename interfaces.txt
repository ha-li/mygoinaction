-general Go naming convention
  if there is only one method, end your interface name with 'er'
  if there are multiple methods, then name the interface in a way that best
  matches the behavior

- when you call a method via an interface type the following rules apply:
   1. if the method is declared with pointer receivers, only interface type
      values that contain pointers can be used
   2. if the method is declared with a value receiver, you can call the
      method with either a pointer or a value type

      eg: a Banker interface

   type Banker interface {
      Transact (account *Account) error
   }

   func (b *Banker) Transact (account *Account);

   only
   boa := new(Banker)
   boa.Transact ( );   // ok
