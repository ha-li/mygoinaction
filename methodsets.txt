a method set is the methods that a receiver is bound to
-the method set will vary based on the type of the receiver
-a value receiver will have a different methodset then a
 point pointer receiver

Value         Method Receivers
------------------------------
 T            (t T)
*T            (t T) and (t *T)

if we redefine this table from the perspective of the method receiver,

Method Receiver      Values
---------------------------
 (t T)               T and *T
 (t *T)              *T

then we see that when the method's receiver is a value, both pointer types
and value types can be used to call the method

 ex: in methodsets.go
 the method ToString is declared with a value receiver, which means
 that both value types and pointer types can be used to call that method
 lines 50, 51

 the method DoTest is declared with a pointer type receiver, so only
 pointer types can call via the method
